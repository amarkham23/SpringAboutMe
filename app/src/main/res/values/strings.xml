I love dogs.
\n\nThe kind that is playful and runs around in the backyard or park, or a field, and definitely loves walks.
\nFun fact is that there are several different kinds of dogs
\n\nSome of my favorite dog breeds are German Shepherds, St. Bernards, Huskies, Labs, and Great Danes.
\nDogs are wonderful, and I hope to have another one some day.
\nIn addition to loving dogs, I also like cats.
\n\n I have two cats of my own, and wish I could get a dog too, however my current home doesnt allow for it.
\n\nI\'ll be happy to get a dog one day after I buy my own house.
\nOne day, after all my hard work in school pays off with a new job!\n\n</string>
